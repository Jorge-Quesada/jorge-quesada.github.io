abstract: >-
  We present the first large-scale benchmarking study for geological fault delineation. The benchmark evaluates over 200 model–dataset–strategy combinations under varying domain shift conditions, providing new insights into generalizability, training dynamics, and evaluation practices in seismic interpretation.
